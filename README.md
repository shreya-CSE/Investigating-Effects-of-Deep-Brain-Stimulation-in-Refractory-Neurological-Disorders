### 2. Specific Aims<a name="specific-aims"></a>

**Big Picture**: This research aims to evaluate the efficacy and durability of DBS as a therapeutic treatment for refractory neurological disorders, contributing to improved patient outcomes.

**Problem(s) Identified**:
- Limited insight into the short-term effects of DBS.
- Critical gap in knowledge regarding the long-term efficacy of DBS.
- Variability in patient responses to DBS.
- Lack of understanding of the exact mechanisms underlying symptom improvement.

**Goals**:
- Assess and quantify the immediate effects of DBS on symptom management.
- Investigate the long-term impact of DBS on disease progression and neurological function.

**Aims**:
1. Evaluate the short-term impact of DBS.
2. Evaluate the long-term impact of DBS.

### 3. Background and Significance<a name="background-and-significance"></a>

**Background**:
- DBS is a surgical method used to mitigate neurological conditions unresponsive to traditional treatments.
- It involves the implantation of electrodes to modulate neural activity.
- DBS has shown promise in managing various neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease and essential tremor.

**Significance**:
- Assessing DBS's impact on neurogenesis and plasticity.
- Personalizing treatment options for better efficacy and reduced side effects.

### 4. Experimental Design<a name="experimental-design"></a>

**Overview**:
- Explore the therapeutic benefits of DBS in refractory neurological disorders.
- Focus on understanding the impact of DBS on symptoms and quality of life.

**Aim 1**:
- Assess short-term effects of DBS.
- Analyze immediate responses to DBS using clinical assessments and neuroimaging.

**Aim 2**:
- Investigate long-term effects of DBS.
- Monitor patients over time to assess disease progression and neurological function.
